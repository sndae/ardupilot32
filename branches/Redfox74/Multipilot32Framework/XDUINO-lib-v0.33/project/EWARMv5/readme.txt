Directory contents
===================
- project .ewd/.eww/.ewp: A pre-configured project file with the provided library 
                          structure that produces an executable image with IAR 
                          Embedded Workbench.
                
- stm32f10x_vector.c: This file contains the vector table for STM32F10x.
                      User can also enable the use of external SRAM mounted on 
                      ET-STM32F103 board as data memory.

- stm32f10x_flash.icf : This file is the IAR specific linking and loading file used 
                        to load in Flash and execute code and variables to target 
                        memories and regions. You can customize this file to your 
                        need.

- stm32f10x_ram.icf:  This file is the IAR specific linking and loading file used 
                      to load in RAM and execute code and variables to target 
                      memories and regions. You can customize this file to your 
                      need.
                       
- cortexm3_macro.s: Instruction wrappers for special Cortex-M3 instructions. 

      
How to use it
=============
- Open the Project.eww workspace.
- In the workspace toolbar select the project config:
    - ET-STM32F103: to configure the project 
- Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all
- Load project image: Project->Debug
- Run program: Debug->Go(F5)
